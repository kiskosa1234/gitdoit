wall of shields
standing strong
on this their chosen battle field



Form the lines 
Shield by shield

here we gooo again.

I knew my rent was gon' be late about a week ago
I worked my ass off
But I still can't pay it though

But I got just enough
To get off in this club
Have me a good time, before my time is up


sss
I'm a fireball
